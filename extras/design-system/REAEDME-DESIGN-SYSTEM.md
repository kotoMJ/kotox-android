## Color palette

### Extract main colors
When creating new theme colors, just find wallpaper image ( or just screen of the app) with suitable colors.
Extract core colors from image using [IMAGE PICKER]

### Create theme (via Figma)
Use [MATERIAL 3 DESIGN KIT] and open it in figma (new design file). Switch (left menu pages) to components in the design kit.
In top menu (RESOURCES) choose plugin MATERIAL THEME BUILDER, update CORE COLORS and press UPDATE button.
This should update all components with the new colors and if all looks good choose EXPORT.

## Launcher icon

Use [ICON KITCHEN] to create basic icon, color it, export it.
