 * This property has a custom getter which returns the object itself, so if we use it on a when block, itâ€™s treated as an expression and the compiler will force us to specify all cases.
 * Let's use this hack for WHEN expression until new version of Kotlin where all WHEN will be exhaustive by default (Yes, breaking change if not used with this hack!!!)
